                The siren is a sea creature capable of being found any where that there is a plentiful amount of fish. It is a creature that spends its time alone avoiding other creatures of the same kind. You will never find more than one within the same area. These creatures are known to be self reproducing and leaving their children when they are very young. This is the only Siren we have sucessfully been able to track due to the species avoiding humans.
